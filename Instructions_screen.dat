Kalashnikov - The Card Game

This is a different kind of card game originally created by youtuber Life of Boris.
The main objective of the player is to get a Kalashnikov gun, i.e., the cards A, K, 4 and 7

This is a two player game, where the players take turns to pick a card from the scrap pile.
The players start with four cards in their respective hands.
If you pick a card which is favorable to you, you can keep it in you hand, replacing it with a card you wish to discard.
When discarding, if the card is either A, K, 4 or 7, the card is sent to the shelf. Otherwise it is sent to the garbage pile.

Shelf acts as a place where you can find cards which can be useful to you.
When the scrap pile is emptied, the players pick the cards from the shelf.

When a player gets a Kalashnikov, the winning player gets to do damage on the losing player and thus score points.

The strength of each card is shown here:
A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2

The player that gets to 20 points first wins the game.
